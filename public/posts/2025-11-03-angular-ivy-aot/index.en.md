# ðŸ§© Chapter 7: Ivy Rendering Engine and AOT Compilation Mechanism (Ivy & AOT)

## 1. Ivy's Background

Before Angular 8, the framework used the **View Engine** rendering architecture.
Its main problems were:
- Complex and redundant template compilation process;
- Unable to load directives and components on demand;
- Unsatisfactory Tree-Shaking results;
- Difficult to debug.

Therefore, the Angular team launched the all-new **Ivy rendering engine** in v8,
aiming to achieve faster compilation, smaller bundle sizes, and easier-to-debug rendering architecture.

## 2. Ivy's Core Design Goals

| Goal | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ðŸ”¹ Smaller | Reduce generated code size |
| ðŸ”¹ Faster | Improve compilation and rendering speed |
| ðŸ”¹ Simpler | Template functionalization, easier to understand |
| ðŸ”¹ Tree-shakable | Remove unused code |
| ðŸ”¹ Backward-compatible | Compatible with legacy applications |

---

## 3. Ivy's Core Concept: Incremental DOM

Ivy uses a mechanism called **Incremental DOM**.
It doesn't create a virtual DOM, but directly generates efficient rendering instruction functions during compilation.

### Example:

#### Template Code
```ts
@Component({
  selector: 'hello-world',
  template: `<h1>Hello {{ name }}</h1>`
})
export class HelloWorldComponent {
  name = 'Angular';
}
```

#### Compiled (Ivy) Code
```ts
ÉµÉµdefineComponent({
  type: HelloWorldComponent,
  selectors: [['hello-world']],
  decls: 2,
  vars: 1,
  template: function HelloWorld_Template(rf, ctx) {
    if (rf & 1) {
      ÉµÉµelementStart(0, 'h1');
      ÉµÉµtext(1);
      ÉµÉµelementEnd();
    }
    if (rf & 2) {
      ÉµÉµtextInterpolate1('Hello ', ctx.name, '');
    }
  }
});
```

### âœ¨ Characteristics:
- Templates are compiled to functions, not string parsing;
- DOM operations are direct instruction-level execution, no virtual DOM diff needed;
- Supports local updates (only updates changed parts).

## 4. Ivy Rendering Flow

The entire rendering flow can be broken down into the following stages:

```
Component Template (HTML)
     â†“ AOT Compilation
Generate Instruction Functions (ÉµÉµ series)
     â†“
Runtime Execute Template Functions
     â†“
Incremental DOM Update
```

### Simplified Flow Diagram:

```
Template â†’ Compiler â†’ Render Instruction â†’ DOM
```

## 5. AOT (Ahead-of-Time) Compilation Mechanism

Angular supports two compilation modes:

| Mode | Characteristics |
|------|-----------------|
| JIT (Just-in-Time) | Runtime template compilation (development mode) |
| AOT (Ahead-of-Time) | Build-time template pre-compilation (production mode) |

AOT compiles templates and directives into JavaScript during the build phase, avoiding runtime parsing overhead.

### âœ… Advantages:
1. **Faster Startup**: Reduces browser runtime compilation;
2. **More Secure**: No dynamic template execution;
3. **Smaller Size**: Removes compiler code;
4. **Early Error Detection**: Compilation-time errors;
5. **Supports Lazy Loading and Tree Shaking.**

---

## 6. Ivy's Instruction Mechanism (ÉµÉµ Series)

Ivy executes rendering logic at runtime through internal functions starting with `ÉµÉµ`.

| Instruction | Function |
|-------------|----------|
| `ÉµÉµelementStart()` / `ÉµÉµelementEnd()` | Create element nodes |
| `ÉµÉµtext()` / `ÉµÉµtextInterpolate()` | Create and update text nodes |
| `ÉµÉµproperty()` | Set properties |
| `ÉµÉµlistener()` | Bind events |
| `ÉµÉµadvance()` | Control pointer position |
| `ÉµÉµpipeBind1()` | Execute pipe binding |

### Example
```ts
if (rf & 2) {
  ÉµÉµproperty('src', ctx.imageUrl);
}
```

This instruction is equivalent to in the template:
```html
<img [src]="imageUrl">
```

---

## 7. Local Detection and `markDirty()`

In Ivy, Angular implements more fine-grained **local change detection**.
When component state changes, simply call:

```ts
import { ÉµmarkDirty as markDirty } from '@angular/core';

markDirty(MyComponent);
```

Angular will only update that component and its subtree in the next detection cycle,
avoiding global detection and improving performance.

---

## 8. Ivy's Optimization Mechanisms

| Optimization Type | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Tree-Shaking** | Unreferenced directives and modules are automatically removed |
| **Code Splitting** | Split compilation output by modules or routes |
| **Template Inlining** | Templates inlined as instruction functions, reducing load time |
| **Incremental Compilation** | Only recompile changed parts, improving build speed |
| **Locality Principle** | Each component compiled independently, not dependent on global context |

---

## 9. Debugging and Development Support

### View Compiled Ivy Output
```bash
ng build --aot
```

In the `dist` directory, you can see compiled template functions (in ÉµÉµ instruction form).

### Enable Production Mode
```ts
import { enableProdMode } from '@angular/core';
enableProdMode(); // Disable debug mode
```

### View Running Instruction Execution
In the browser console, you can get component instances via `ng.getComponent(element)`.

## 10. Ivy vs View Engine Comparison

| Comparison Item | View Engine | Ivy |
|-----------------|-------------|-----|
| Compilation Method | Generate classes and view factories | Template to functions (instruction-based) |
| Size | Large | Smaller |
| Rendering Performance | Global detection | Local detection |
| Debuggability | Complex | Simple, functionalized |
| Build Speed | Slow | Fast |
| Tree-Shaking | Weak | Strong |
| Backward Compatibility | Legacy architecture | Fully compatible |

---

## 11. AOT vs JIT Compilation Flow Comparison

```
AOT Mode:
Template + TS â†’ Compiler â†’ JS Files (ÉµÉµ functions) â†’ Browser Load

JIT Mode:
Template + TS â†’ Browser Runtime Parsing â†’ Dynamic Compilation Execution
```

| Comparison Item | JIT | AOT |
|-----------------|-----|-----|
| Compilation Timing | Runtime | Build-time |
| Initial Load Performance | Slower | Fast |
| Bundle Size | Large | Small |
| Security | Lower | High |
| Debuggability | Strong | Weak (functionalized after compilation) |
