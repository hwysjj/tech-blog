# ðŸ§© Chapter 9: Appendix and Extension (Source Code Reading and Knowledge Expansion)

## 1. React Source Code Overall Structure Overview

React is a **MonoRepo (multi-package repository)** composed of multiple sub-packages, with source code hosted on GitHub:

```
https://github.com/facebook/react
```

Main directory structure:

```
react/
 â”œâ”€â”€ packages/
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ react/                  â†’ React API definitions, such as useState, createElement
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ react-dom/              â†’ DOM renderer
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ react-reconciler/       â†’ Fiber reconciler (core part)
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ scheduler/              â†’ Scheduling system
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ shared/                 â†’ Utility functions and type definitions
 â”‚   â””â”€â”€ legacy/experimental/    â†’ Experimental features and legacy architecture compatibility
 â”œâ”€â”€ fixtures/                   â†’ Official test and experimental projects
 â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/                    â†’ Build scripts and packaging configuration
 â””â”€â”€ packages.json               â†’ Package dependency entry point
```

## 2. Key Source Code Modules and Function Description

| Module | Location | Function Description |
|--------|----------|----------------------|
| `react` | `packages/react` | React core API (such as useState, useEffect) |
| `react-dom` | `packages/react-dom` | DOM rendering logic: convert Fiber to real DOM |
| `react-reconciler` | `packages/react-reconciler` | Core reconciliation algorithm: Fiber, updates, Diff, priority control |
| `scheduler` | `packages/scheduler` | Task scheduling system, foundation of React 18 time slicing |
| `shared` | `packages/shared` | Common constants and utility methods |
| `react-test-renderer` | `packages/react-test-renderer` | Simulate rendering environment during testing |

---

## 3. Source Code Reading Recommended Order (From Easy to Hard)

| Stage | Reading Module | Goal |
|-------|----------------|------|
| â‘  Basic Module | `react` | Understand React API implementation, such as useState |
| â‘¡ Rendering Module | `react-dom` | Learn rendering process (mount/update/unmount) |
| â‘¢ Reconciliation Module | `react-reconciler` | Master Fiber architecture and Diff implementation |
| â‘£ Scheduling Module | `scheduler` | Understand time slicing and task priority mechanism |
| â‘¤ Overall Debugging | fixtures | Debug full process through example projects |

---

## 4. Source Code Reading Techniques

### âœ… 1. Enable Source Code Debugging
Clone project and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebook/react.git
cd react
yarn install
```

Build debugging environment:
```bash
yarn build react,react-dom,scheduler --type=DEV
```

---

### âœ… 2. Entry Point Location (From API to Fiber)
React execution main line:

```
useState â†’ ReactCurrentDispatcher â†’ FiberUpdateQueue â†’ scheduleUpdateOnFiber
```

Key function jump route:
```
useState()
  â†“
mountState / updateState
  â†“
dispatchAction()
  â†“
enqueueUpdate()
  â†“
scheduleUpdateOnFiber()
  â†“
performConcurrentWorkOnRoot()
```

---

### âœ… 3. View Update Scheduling
Key debugging files:
- `ReactFiberWorkLoop.js`
- `ReactFiberReconciler.js`
- `ReactFiberHooks.js`
- `Scheduler.js`

Breakpoint locations:
- `performUnitOfWork`
- `commitRoot`
- `scheduleCallback`

---

## 5. React 18 New Mechanism Source Code Entry Points

| Module | Source Code File | Function |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| startTransition | `ReactFiberTransition.js` | Low-priority task scheduling |
| useDeferredValue | `ReactFiberHooks.js` | Deferred value updates |
| Lane Model | `ReactFiberLane.js` | Multi-priority task control |
| Automatic Batching | `ReactDOMRoot.js` | Same-frame task merging |
| Concurrent Mode | `ReactFiberWorkLoop.js` | Interruptible rendering main logic |

## ðŸ”š Epilogue: From Framework to Mindset

> When you can draw a Fiber flow diagram,
> Clearly explain the logic of the Diff algorithm,
> Understand how the Scheduler makes the UI smooth,
>
> Then, you are not just a "React Engineer",
> But a "Developer Who Understands System Design Thinking".

> The greatest inspiration React brings is not technology, but mindset:
> â€”â€” **Declarative UI thinking centered on scheduling.**
