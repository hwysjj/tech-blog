# üß© Chapter 5: React Event System and Performance Optimization Principles (Practical + Interview Edition)

## 1. React Synthetic Event (SyntheticEvent) Principles

### ‚úÖ Background
In browsers, the native event system has the following problems:
- Different browser event models are incompatible
- Event bindings scattered across nodes
- Large number of event listeners affects performance

To unify the event system and improve performance, React introduced **SyntheticEvent**.

---

## 2. How React's Event Mechanism Works

### üîç Execution Flow
1Ô∏è‚É£ Events (like `onClick`, `onChange`) are not bound directly to real DOM nodes;
2Ô∏è‚É£ React binds a unified event listener at the component root node (like `document` or `root`);
3Ô∏è‚É£ When an event triggers, React bubbles up from the event source (target) based on event type, simulating native event propagation;
4Ô∏è‚É£ React calls developer-registered event callbacks;
5Ô∏è‚É£ All events are wrapped in `SyntheticEvent` objects with consistent APIs.

---

### üß© Concept Diagram (Description)

```
[Real DOM Click Event]

      ‚Üì
Constructs SyntheticEvent Object
      ‚Üì
Simulates Event Bubbling by Fiber Tree Structure
      ‚Üì
Calls Component's onClick / onChange Callbacks
```

---

### üí° Example Code

```jsx
function App() {
  function handleClick(e) {
    console.log("React event object:", e);
    console.log("Native event object:", e.nativeEvent);
  }
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
}
```

Print result:
```
React event object: SyntheticEvent {...}
Native event object: PointerEvent {...}
```

React wraps browser native events into unified SyntheticEvent for consistent cross-browser behavior.

---

## 3. Event Delegation Mechanism

### ‚úÖ Principle
React doesn't bind event listeners to each element individually, but **delegates** all events to the top-level node.

```jsx
<div onClick={handleParent}>
  <button onClick={handleChild}>Click Me</button>
</div>
```

React actually registers event listener only once on `document`:
```
document.addEventListener('click', dispatchEvent)
```
Then uses **event bubbling** to find corresponding component and trigger callbacks.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Advantages
| Advantage | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Better Performance | Requires only few event listeners |
| Unified Management | All events handled centrally in React layer |
| Cross-browser Consistency | Uses SyntheticEvent wrapper |

---

## 4. Differences in Stopping Propagation vs Native Events

In React, the event system is wrapped, so `stopPropagation()` and `preventDefault()` behave slightly differently from native.

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div onClick={() => console.log("Parent div clicked")}>
      <button onClick={(e) => {
        e.stopPropagation(); // Stops React synthetic event bubbling
        console.log("Button clicked");
      }}>
        Click Button
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

> Note: `e.nativeEvent.stopPropagation()` stops **native event** bubbling;
> React's `e.stopPropagation()` only stops React-level event propagation.

---

## 5. React Event System Phases

React 18 event system has three phases:

| Phase | Characteristic | Usage |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| Capture Phase | Top to bottom | Register with `onClickCapture` |
| Bubble Phase | Bottom to top | Default `onClick` triggers |
| Default Phase | Synthetic event handling | For compatibility wrapping |

---

## 6. Performance Optimization Mechanisms

React's core performance optimization philosophy:
> Reduce unnecessary renders + Lower rendering overhead.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ React.memo ‚Äî Cache Component Results

**Principle:**
If component props haven't changed, React.memo skips rendering.

```jsx
const Child = React.memo(({ name }) => {
  console.log("Child component rendering");
  return <p>{name}</p>;
});
```

**Use Cases:**
- Parent updates frequently but child props unchanged
- Long lists, tables, and other child components

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ useMemo ‚Äî Cache Computation Results

```jsx
const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => heavyCompute(a, b), [a, b]);
```

React records previous dependencies `[a, b]`, reuses old value if unchanged.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ useCallback ‚Äî Cache Function References

```jsx
const handleClick = useCallback(() => doSomething(id), [id]);
```

Prevents child re-renders when parent re-renders.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ React.lazy + Suspense ‚Äî Lazy Loading Mechanism

```jsx
const Profile = React.lazy(() => import('./Profile'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <Profile />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

**Principle:**
- `React.lazy` dynamically imports components
- `Suspense` displays fallback placeholder

---

## 7. Performance Optimization Case Study

### üîç Problem Example

```jsx
function Parent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const handleClick = () => console.log("clicked");

  return (
    <>
      <Child onClick={handleClick} />
      <button onClick={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}>Add</button>
    </>
  );
}

const Child = React.memo(({ onClick }) => {
  console.log("Child component rendering");
  return <button onClick={onClick}>Child</button>;
});
```

**Problem:**
Parent creates a new `handleClick` function object each render, causing child to re-render.

**‚úÖ Optimization:**
```jsx
const handleClick = useCallback(() => console.log("clicked"), []);
```

## 8. Common Interview Questions and Answer Points

### ‚ùì1. What's the Difference Between React Events and Native Events?

- React uses SyntheticEvent wrapper
- Unified cross-browser interface
- Bound to root node via event delegation
- Interruptible, batched execution

### ‚ùì2. Why Does React Use Event Delegation?

- Unified event management
- Supports virtual DOM node mapping

### ‚ùì3. Difference Between React.memo and useMemo?
| Name | Caches | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| React.memo | Component render result | Avoid duplicate renders |
| useMemo | Computation result | Avoid duplicate calculations |

### ‚ùì4. When to Use useCallback?
**Answer Strategy:**

- Child optimized with React.memo
- Maintain stable function reference

### ‚ùì5. How Does React.lazy Work?
**Answer Strategy:**
- Uses dynamic import to async load components
