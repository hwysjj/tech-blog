# 📘 React Principles and Interview Practical Guide
### —— Complete Learning Manual from Core Mechanisms to Performance Optimization

---

## 📖 Preface

React is one of the essential core frameworks for frontend engineers.
But most people are just "using React" rather than "understanding React".

This book follows the **Principles → Practice → Interview** approach,
helping you grow from a framework user to an engineer who understands underlying mechanisms.

## 🧩 Complete Book Structure Overview

| Chapter | Title | Main Content |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| Chapter 1 | **Virtual DOM and Rendering Principles** | React's core philosophy: Virtual DOM, Diff algorithm, meaning of Key |
| Chapter 2 | **Fiber Architecture and Rendering Mechanism** | React 16 refactoring: Fiber architecture, interruptible rendering, priority scheduling |
| Chapter 3 | **Hook Principles and Mechanisms** | Hook linked list, useState/useEffect principles, custom Hooks |
| Chapter 4 | **Rendering and Update Mechanism** | setState execution flow, Diff algorithm, batching and lifecycle |
| Chapter 5 | **Event System and Performance Optimization** | SyntheticEvent system, event delegation, React.memo/useMemo optimization |
| Chapter 6 | **Concurrent Features and Scheduler System** | React 18 new features: Scheduler, startTransition, useDeferredValue |
| Chapter 7 | **Advanced Optimization and Interview Summary** | Performance optimization strategies, virtual lists, answer frameworks, practical recommendations |
| Chapter 8 | **Complete Summary and Practical Path Guide** | Systematic learning path, interview answer models and practical implementation recommendations |

## 🌱 Learning Recommendations

### 1️⃣ Reading Order
Recommended to follow chapter sequence (1 → 8), from underlying concepts to application optimization, progressing layer by layer.
Each chapter ends with hands-on practice and interview question summaries.

### 2️⃣ Learning Methods
- **Understanding + Simulation**: Hand-write useState, Diff, Fiber
- **Practice + Observation**: Analyze rendering through Chrome Profiler
- **Explanation + Output**: Explain each principle in your own words

### 3️⃣ Recommended Tools
- React Developer Tools (view Fiber Tree)
- Chrome Performance / Profiler (analyze scheduling time slices)
- CodeSandbox / StackBlitz (online experimentation)

## 🔧 Appendix: Practical Exercise Recommendations

| Exercise Type | Example | Goal |
|---------------|---------|------|
| Principle Implementation | Hand-write useState and useEffect | Understand Hook operating principles |
| Scheduling Experiment | Simulate Fiber linked list updates | Understand time slicing execution |
| Performance Comparison | Add React.memo / useCallback | Verify optimization effects |
| Concurrent Mode | Use startTransition | Experience React 18 smooth interaction |
| Long List Optimization | Use react-window | Master virtual list performance techniques |

---

## 💬 Interview Intensive Training Path

| Module | High-Frequency Questions | Thinking Framework |
|--------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Virtual DOM | Why doesn't React directly manipulate DOM? | Performance abstraction, Diff algorithm |
| Fiber | Why introduce Fiber? | Interruptible rendering, priority scheduling |
| Hook | Why can't Hooks be in if? | Fixed call order, Hook linked list |
| setState | Why async? | Batching mechanism, update queue |
| useEffect | When does it execute? | Commit phase, async side effects |
| Optimization | Difference between React.memo and useMemo? | Cache component vs cache result |
| Concurrent Rendering | What does startTransition do? | Low-priority scheduling, smooth interaction |

---

## 🧠 Final Goals

After reading this book, you should be able to:
1. Clearly explain React's update mechanism
2. Hand-write simplified version of Fiber / useState
3. Have systematic diagnostic approach for performance bottlenecks
4. Express React principles in structured way during interviews
5. Lead performance optimization and code standards in your team

## 🎯 Author's Message

> React is not just a UI library,
> it's an **architectural philosophy centered on scheduling**.
>
> When you understand Virtual DOM abstraction, Fiber interruption, Hook linked list, and Scheduler,
> you'll discover: every React design is to make frontend faster, more stable, and more elegant.
